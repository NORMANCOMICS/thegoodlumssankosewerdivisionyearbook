## ðŸ’¸ Multi-Currency Minting on the Sanko Chain
The Goodlums Sanko Sewer Division Yearbook collection introduces a unique **multi-currency minting system**, allowing users to mint exclusive, yield-bearing PFPs using various gang-affiliated currencies on Sanko Chain alongside the primary currency, **$DMT**. This flexibility enhances accessibility, empowering users to engage with the collection through the currency of their choice.

> **Note:** Prices for gang-related currencies are subject to change due to market fluctuations and gang-related taxation.

### Supported Gang-Related Currencies for Minting

### Project Origins
The GOODLUMS began before the advent of blockchain. With the discovery of **web9**, the project launched on Ethereum, expanded to Bitcoin via Counterparty ($XCP) and BTC Stamps, then made its way to Base and Degen. Finally, the GOODLUMS found a home on **Sanko Chain ($DMT)**, attracting a community of true degens. Additional hidden spin-off tokens and assets are minted on undisclosed chains, awaiting discovery by dedicated users.
